            <p> This assignment, I really wanted to test my limitations and see what I could do with everything I've learned so far in this semester. The assignment is for a horror-themed video blog project. I chose this project because it sounded like a lot of fun.
                <br>
                <br>Using A.I. for this project helped me remember the minor details that I would typically forget. This research also allowed me to learn about and explore how artificial intelligence can be applied, as well as its existing limitations. It is an excellent tool for learning and truly understanding what you are doing. I used Claude.AI because of its ability to explain things clearly for coding. I used a generative A.I. website called Runway for generative video editing. Lastly, I used Gencraft.com for any images used.
