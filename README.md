# dtc355-retro-site

A retro-inspired multi-page portfolio blog created as part of my coursework for DTC 355: Digital Publishing. This project was built using HTML5 and CSS3 and reflects the nostalgic design aesthetic of late 90s–early 2000s websites.

## 💡 About the Project

This assignment really pushed me to test my limitations and see what I could do with everything I’ve learned so far this semester. The goal was to create a horror-themed video blog site — I chose this direction because it sounded like a lot of fun and gave me creative freedom to explore nostalgic web design.

I incorporated **A.I. tools** throughout the project to support and accelerate my creative process. Tools I used:

- **Claude.AI** — for help breaking down complex coding tasks into understandable steps
- **Runway ML** — for generative video editing
- **Gencraft.com** — for creating images using generative AI

Working with these tools gave me firsthand insight into the strengths and limits of AI in creative tech workflows. It also helped me remember small but crucial technical details I might have otherwise overlooked.
